Human Resource Dashboard allows to get overview of the company employees. This HR Insights defines employees remote work and attendance. Most of the employees like to take work from home from week ends. Based on the insights we can easily notice the employee health condition and at the same time we can manage the company maintenance, Team lunch and other extra curricular activates

ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics:

ðŸ“† Attendance %: We calculated and visualized the overall attendance percentage, providing a clear view of workforce presence.
ðŸ’¼ WFH % (Work from Home): In today's dynamic work environment, we evaluated the Work from Home percentage to understand the flexible work culture's impact.
ðŸ¤’ SL % (Sick Leave): Tracking sick leave percentages is vital for employee health and organizational planning.

ðŸ“Š Visualization:

We brought these metrics to life using Power BI. We designed a dynamic dashboard featuring line charts that illustrated how these statistics changed over time. The line charts allowed us to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement.

ðŸ“Œ Significance:

Effective HR analytics is crucial for businesses looking to optimize their workforce, enhance productivity, and create a healthy work environment. By harnessing data and creating visually engaging reports, we can make informed decisions that benefit both employees and the organization.
